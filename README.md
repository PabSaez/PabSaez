### About Me :

Welcome to my GitHub ! This repository showcases some of my academic projects completed during my Bachelor's at HEIG-VD and will also feature my future open-source contributions. I am a junior cybersecurity engineer currently pursuing a Master's degree to deepen my expertise. I have a strong interest in high-level security analysis and conducting security audits.
